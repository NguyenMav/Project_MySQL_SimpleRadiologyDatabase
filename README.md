**Project SimpleRadiologyDatabase**

This is a personal SQL project where I try to apply what I learned from university unit database management and try to build my own database. I used MySQL workbench along with MySQL Server. Everything produced including the tables and entities are all hypothetical and is not real - they're made based off my domain knowledge of healthcare as someone with a radiology background.

This is the ERD I made with crow foot notations, before I tried implementing it into a database.
